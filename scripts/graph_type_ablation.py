"""Ablation: what does a model assume when the serialization omits the graph type?

For an undirected graph the Erdos graph-as-code (M3) prompt stated the graph type only if the task
preamble did (docs/erdos-m3-graph-type-rerun.md section 1). The rerun that states it for
every undirected graph (`configs/erdos_m3fix.yaml`) turns that defect into a controlled
one-sentence ablation: the same model, task, graph and template, with one fact present or absent.

Three questions, three tables under results/erdos_m3fix/tables/ablation/:

  task_sensitivity.csv  Which tasks reveal the misreading? Per model x library x task, canonical
                        accuracy with the type omitted vs stated, from records (base_source =
                        "records"); a model whose base records are absent falls back to the base
                        run's committed per-model tables (base_source = "tables").
  latent_misreading.csv Did the model misread the input even where the answer was right? In the
                        NetworkX arm the sandbox recovers the graph the program built, so
                        `directedness_mismatch` is direct evidence of a DiGraph on undirected
                        input. Cross-tabulated with correctness. Needs base-run records: Qwen3-8B
                        and DeepSeek-V3.1 from the local run, Gemma 4 31B and DeepSeek-V4-Flash
                        from the team dataset (results/hf_snapshot_yoni/).
  recovery.csv          After the sentence is added: mismatch rate and accuracy, all four models.

Graph direction is observed only where the sandbox recovered a graph object (`n_graphs` > 0): never
in the native arm, and not for a NetworkX-arm program that builds no graph. `directedness_mismatch`
is stored as False in those records too, so every DiGraph share here is taken over recovered
graphs only, next to their count (`n_recovered`), and is empty when none was recovered.

No inference and no program execution; reads scored records and committed tables.
