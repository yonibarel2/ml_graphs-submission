"""Where a wrong answer was born.

The template gives every code-mode program the same three visible stages, so a failure
can be attributed to one of them rather than lumped into "wrong":

    truth --[1]--> declared nodes/edges --[2]--> the graph the code used --[3]--> ans

  [1] transcription   the model copied the graph wrong
  [2] construction    it declared the graph correctly, then built something else from it
  [3] logic           it had the right graph and still got the answer wrong

`no_computation` sits outside that chain: the program wrote `ans` as a literal, so it
never entered the chain at all. It is checked before correctness, since a hardcoded
answer that happens to be right is not a solved task.

`construction` needs a networkx graph to compare against, so it is separable in the
`networkx` library arm only. In the `native` arm there is no graph object to recover and
construction errors are reported as `logic`; the two must never be pooled across arms.
