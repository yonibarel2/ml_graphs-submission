"""Interaction modes and prompt construction.

Three modes, two of which are crossed with a `library` arm:

  M1 direct         answer in prose; G1/Herbst wording, final answer in \\boxed{}.
  M2 code           CodeGraph format; the model fills a template whose first two lines
                    declare `nodes` and `edges`, then writes the solving code.
  M3 graph_as_code  the identical template with those two lines filled by the harness
                    and the graph text removed: M2 minus transcription.

`library` selects the solving toolkit (`networkx` or `native`) and is crossed with the
two code modes, never nested inside the mode name -- so `mode in CODE_MODES` stays a
two-element membership test no matter how many library arms exist.

The template is what makes transcription observable. Because `nodes` and `edges` are
always assigned first and always by that name, the harness can read what graph the model
*declared* and compare it to the truth, independently of how the model went on to solve.
M3 receives the same skeleton, so the two modes differ in exactly one thing: who fills
those two lines.
